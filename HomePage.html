	<h2> What is Altruism? </h2>
	<img src = "Altruism.jpg" alt = "404 image missing" height = "230px" width = "500">
	<p>-	Altruism is a behavior where animals and other organisms benefit others first over themselves (a form of selflessness)<br/> 
	to increase the ability for the population to reproduce and continue, instead of prioritizing the organism’s own ability to <br/>

	<h2> Kin selection vs. Altruism </h2>
	<div id  = "kin information">
		<h3> What is the difference? </h3>
		<p>-	While pure altruism is benefiting all your species or even those from other species, kin selection is when you help <br/>
		others with the intent of being able to reproduce or increase the chances of their future generations reproducing causing <br/>
		the longer continuation of the species.</p>
	</div>
	<div id = "kin importance">
		<h3> Why is kin selection impotant? </h3>
		<p>- Well, when running simulations for instance the ones by primer, pure altruism, is very hard for altruism genes to continue <br/>
		in the wild because the organisms are to focus on helping others before themselves, so they die out or won’t reproduce. <br/>
		Kin selection heightens the chance that organisms reproduce because they are partially focused on themselves and their <br/>
		reproductive chances while helping their other parts of society mostly their family.</p>
	</div>
	<div id = "kin works">
		<h3> Why does kin selcetion work? </h3>
		<p> Kin selection works so well because of Hamilton’s Rule: the cost of the altruistic action must be less than the relation <br/>
		of the two organisms, times the benefit of the action. For example, a biologist by the name of J.B.S Haldane said this when asked:<br/>
		“Would you lay down your life for your brother?” “No, but I would for two brothers or eight cousins,” he replied.</p>

<div id = "fitness comparison">
	<h2> Direct fitness vs. Indirect Fitness </h2>
    <div id = "fitness">
		<h3> What is diferent between direct and indirect fitness? </h3>
		<p> Direct fitness is the measurement of an organism’s ability to be able to bear children and its ability to pass on its genes. <br/>
		While an organism’s indirect fitness is a measurement of how much the organism’s ability to help its species’ population be able <br/>
		to reproduce and continue to thrive.</p>
