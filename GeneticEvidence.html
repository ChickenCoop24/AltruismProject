			<h2> Genetic Evidence for Altruism </h2>
				<h3> How are altruistic traits created, and spread?</h3>
				<p>- Altruistic traits usually spring up by random, as mutations and usually stick around because it helps a species indirect fitness and so the <br/>
				genes are passed in throughout the species. For example in the prairie dogs, they have a greater chance of surviving if they can be notified of <br/>
				the hawks and stay alive so the gene spreads through the population.</p>

				<h2> Evolutionary Standpoint of Altruism</h2>
				<h3> -	Understanding of the opposing thoughts of the causes and evolution of altruism </h3>
				<img src = "Evolution.jpg" alt = "404 image missing" height = "250px" width = "500px">
				<p> -	People often think that it would be hard for altruism to evolve because natural selection relies on an increase of direct fitness for a <br/>
				trait to be expressed, but altruistic trait doesn’t usually result in that change in direct fitness and often comes with a penalty. <br/>
				Although we aren’t considering sexual selection also must come into play, for example, male chimps may groom others for the attraction <br/>
				of mates which because of sexual selection could cause the altruistic gene to be passed on to increase fitness related to sexual selection.
