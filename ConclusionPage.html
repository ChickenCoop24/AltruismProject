		<h2> Examples of Altruism in the Wild </h2>
			<h3> Prairie Dogs in the Wild </h3>
				<p>-	Prairie dogs are a good example of general altruism, a prairie dog may whistle if their population is in danger from predators like hawks <br/>
				to warn the rest of the population to protect the rest of the population but the tradeoff is that the whistler may end up being eaten. <br/>
				This event will decrease the individual’s direct fitness, but its indirect fitness will increase drastically as the population now continues to thrive. </p>

			<h3> Ravens in the Wild</h3>
				<p>-	Ravens are another good example altruism, when they come upon a moose or animal they can eat from, the raven will create a call to gather <br/>
				other ravens to come and eat the animals carcass, this increase the indirect and direct fitness of the organism because the can continue to eat and <br/>
				help out the population, this is beneficial to all organisms because the animals circus could be too big to just supply a single bird so the group of <br/>
				birds can get more out of the food than just one individual. </p>

		<h2>Comparison of Altruism and Eusociality</h2>
			<h3>Can Altruism and Eusociality be Compared</h3>
				<p>Well while eusociality is a population of multiple organisms to benefit a single leader organism, this can be seen in honeybees as they try to feed the <br/>
				queen and will risk their lives to save the queen as the queen is the only way for the population to reproduce. In altruism, all organisms can reproduce and<br/>
				so they have themselves to worry about. As well, both involve selfless actions to be made but in altruism, the individual is more worried about preserving their genes. </p>

			<h3>Are Humans Altruistic?</h3>
				<p>Since most humans can reproduce and think for themselves, you could make the point that we are not Eusocial, but what about the taxes and support we give<br/>
				to our leaders and how everyone always pays taxes and buy items to support the leaders. Our taxes are those we are mandated to pay, and our society needs us <br/>
				to buy items, it’s almost impossible for us to survive without buying items, because of this I believe humans re not Eusocial but instead Altruistic. <br/>
				Humans are naturally willing to help others and will help others even if it’s to the detriment of their jobs or niche in society. <br/>
				You could say that humans are neither because it's our society that forces us to be Altruistic or Eusocial, but humans have been willing to help others<br/>
				since the beginning of modern humans. In conclusion, humans can be described as Altruistic but not eusocial because of our society and our natural desire<br/>
				to help others. </p>
